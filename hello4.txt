 Wrong information from ernakulam railway station parcels service they said to get the parcel from bangalore railway just give the receipt number i'd proof and phone number and take the parcel and if want i could even give a scaned copy of the receipt when i went to the parcel office they told me to get the original receipt from ernakulam and the office staff in bangalore are so lazy they don't hear or respect any customer they don't need the i'd proof or nothing if in case i lost my receipt and somebody gets the receipt do they give the parcel to anyone without any proof who ever go with the original receipt that's fine no matter if it's the wrong person very bad service the staff's are very rude   
 It's a request not a complaint:We should get note in news update or notification from indian railways through their indicator apps for delay of trains.Reason for this request because of sudden delay of trains whether its in during the monsoon season or with any other reason, there has to be some notifications. Even if we reach office late by 5 mins we have to bear/ sacrifice our half day salary.In other countries, the train travellers get physical note if the train get delay so they can show in their office. We are just asking for notifications which should be reflecting in the railway apps like m-indicator or p-indicator on the basis of location.Hope such sensible point will be consider and implement for the benefits of common people.

 I travelled from ambala kent to ahmedabad on date 10/08/2017 -11/08/2017 with train no 12474 in sleeper coach s/4. As i need to use standing toilet, i used standing (European) toilet of adjoining coach s/5. Firstly i cleaned the toilet as it was not flushed by previous user. One could not use flushing as there was no connection of flushing system i. E. Vertical pipe with flushing valve to w c pan. Water flow system was also closed for flushing pipeline. This seem to be high negligance of maintanance department at end stations by inspection as well as supervisory staff. There must be system of inspection as well as supervision for long route trains for such sanitatio issues. I could not photos as the size of photos were more than 2 mb.

 Dear Sir, I’m writing this mail in order to bring the matter of misbehavior by one of the ticket examiner at Durgapur (dgr) station on the morning of 26.08.17.On the morning of 26.08.17 after I got down from Mayurakshi Fast Passenger (53046) at Durgapur station, I was asked to show the ticket by one of the ticket examiner at the main exit at Platform no. 1. After I handed the ticket he examiner cancelled the ticket & refused to hand me over the same citing some law. When I asked him that how was I supposed to claim by travel expense he rudely replied that it was not his lookout & pointed towards a box where it was written to submit the tickets in it. He also took me to an office where he showed me a register where details of some tickets were noted but he could not show me any memo/notification/written record which could support his claim.Yet when I kept insisting for the ticket he threatened me to arrest me & keep me in custody as long as required as he is the representative of the president of the union of India & he has the authority to do so. At this point of I was so exasperated that even I asked him to arrest me as he was preparing to lodge an FIR against me on the ground of causing hindrance to a railway official while discharging his duty. Now another senior official rushed into the room & asked the examiner to let me go & asked him to get back to his workplace as he had left the exit gate un-manned. During this entire period he kept yelling at me hurling derogatory remarks at me. Only after the other person intervened, his voice became soft & he advised me either to ask my company to write a letter to the railway ministry asking for numbered ticket or simply slip out of the station through any un-manned exit without being detected.Now, my question is, is there really any law like this & if so, is there any official notification there ? Everytime I requested an examiner to return the ticket I was given so without any questions being asked. Here I was threatened with prison time & was mis-behaved only for having to know any particular law. I was also told that I was not invited by the railways to avail it’s services.I am writing this report with this expectation that my grievance will not fall in deaf ears & no other passenger is harassed like this.I am attaching the ticket for which all this has happened.Also this particular examiner didn’t have any name plate on him.With regardsAbhradeep Goswami

 This case is of march 2012, and wanted to inform to railways that my wife was traveling from gadarwara to kurla mumbai in rajendra nager express, in which we lost jewelry around inr 5 lacs that time, we have raised our complaint by filing fir, and zero fir at kurla mumbai.The theft had happened near manmad junction, However there has been no result for it after 5 years also, the fir has not generated any results and could not get our lost jewelry.I want to complain here after seeing the recent thefts in rajdhani express, wanted to say if we pay a higher price for a second ac, how there is no proper safety provided by the railways, most of the thefts happen in 2 tier ac compartments where there is a lesser crowd.The irony is how some one can get inside a coach and steal our valuables.This loss has brought a lot of distress in our family, my wife lost all her jewelry and we were asked to run poll and pillars for making a fir which was also a tiresome task.I was also going for a legal option to go against railway, however, dint do it thinking that there could be no recourse and it is already 4 to 5 years to that event.I wanted to bring to your notice the kind of dilemma we face and there has been absolutely no recourse available if we are unlucky affected ones by that event.I hereby wanted to ask whose is the primary responsibility for safety in trains, especially where we pay extra for additional comfort and safety, why we are put at higher risk than the ones in 3 tier ac or for that matter sleeper.Hereby if there has been proper checks and control in place that time we wouldn't have lost our jewelry.Security cameras should be there at least in a 3 tier ac compartments. Have thought railways being government will never take the responsibilities because person effects are to be taken care by passengers, however, if there are trespassers who perform such act responsibility surely lies with railways.   
 Hello! My issue about railway is.. Being a regular passenger of local trains, i'm facing problems because of late run of trains. I catch a local from titwala everyday (Titwala to cst - 7.53 am) but this train reaches at 9.30 to 9.33 to dadar which is late by 15 mins everyday. So, today i caught train at 7.30 but this train also reached at dadar around 9.30 which should be reached at 8.52 as per it's official time. And railway management do not take any initiative to announce that trains are running late despite there is a facility available in trains. Why everyone should face this problem everyday? What kind of management is this?Can you explain or do something about it?? Indian railways

 I tried to book 2 senior citizen tickets online for me and my wife in 2ac in doronto express. It showed 50 berths available (In two 2ac coaches). After making the payment, it asked you are getting berths in 2 different coaches whether you want to book? It happened four times, my amount was deducted 4 times, each time it asked the same question. Again same thing happened when i tried to book two senior citizen berth 2ac in august kranti rajdhani from nizamuddin to mumbai central. This time it showed 84 berths available but again my amount got deducted and it asked about berths being booked in two different coaches.I have never seen such a shabby treatment to senior citizens from indian railways. What is wrong with irctc system? Is it malfunctioning? Why senior citizens are being targeted in this way?Also there is no guarantee that even after availability of so many berths we will get the lower berth. Does indian railways want senior citizens to climb up the upper berths at this old age? I think indian railways instead of moving forward are going down and down.An unhappy frequent traveller.Raj kumar sethAge: 67 yearsMumbaiPh: +91-[protected]

 Iwe are senior citizens who had booked by the above train to bengaluru city station from toranagallu on 21.08.2017. Initially we got a message that the train is delayed by 4 hours. Thereafter it kept on getting delayed. Even the telephone calls to hubli railway station master did not yield any correct information. Ultimately there was a delay more than 7 hours and we were staying at donimalai township and at that time to find a conveyance and reach the place was almost impossible. When we attempted to apply for refund of the tickets, we were informed that tdr has to be filed within 30 minutes. Forget about the rules, there is no consideration of being a senior citizen of more than 74 years. My pnr [protected]. Because of this delay i had to cancel my onward reservation to delhi by rajdhani and incur further cancellation charges. Is this a public service by a government transporter? This matter has to be looked into and refund granted.RegardsRamamurthy

 Hi,  This is a suggestion on reservation which will really improve the standard of our railway service from customer point of view. Let's say i am travelling from rasp (Rasipuram) to hsra (Hosur). But normally i will not get confirmed ticket from rasipuram to hosur. So i book it from sa (Salem) to hsra (Hosur) and boarding at rasipuram with general ticket. Ideally speaking fare from sa to hsra and rasp to hsra is same which is rs.140. My suggestion is why should i need to take general ticket in case if the fare is same.. Instead you can provide Some options like reserved from here to here and boarding at some point in case if the fare is same. If the fare is not same then you can include the additional cost for rasp to sa in total fare. I know all dumb people only sitting in the government and you don't even understand what i'm trying to say since i have faced lots of irritating foul response from many department customer interface of government of india. I'm already worrying more like why did we got freedom atleast british would've run corruption less government even i'm not offered free stuff from government.. Please consider this request with some value and do the needful.   
 At platform no -1, the escalator staff who is on duty at 5:30, 20-8-2017 upward escalator behaved very rudely with me and my husband, we travelling with two little kids, iam handling my kids at the escalator and my husband is carrying the luggage with one hand and holding the sides of the escalator, he asked to lift the luggage with the hands how can a person holds luggage without any support, when we asked why? He switched off the escalator and started arguing since there is heavy rush we have done according to him, if my husband fells down (Patient) what happens? I would really like to know whether railways has introduced any norm that luggage should not be kept on the escalator with a hand on it and it should be lifted up in the air without holding the sides of the escalator.

 The sign boards presently displayed on the sides of train compartments show various train names, and destinations. This is confusing the passengers looking for their particular train. This also creates the risk of passengers boarding the wrong train. The problem is aggravated for those who are not familiar with the regular local trains or are new to the place.It is suggested that only the relevant sign board is installed in the particular train so there is no confusion created. This was the method adopted earlier.   
 The printing of details on the train ticket (Train no., from, to, date, time of boarding etc.) are printed in very small font making them unreadable by those who are sight impaired and senior citizens and are putting them to hardships. They sometimes take the wrong ticket or take the wrong time to reach the station. It is suggested that the font size of the printing is made larger to make the details easily readable by passengers.   
 I booked a ticket on train no 12521 to chalakudy. Departure time should be 11:50pm but at the time i reached station there was a notification that the train will be arriving at 4:20am and i was not informed or got any sms as i have booked online through irctc. I was waiting there for almost five hours and at 4 am arrival time changed to 5am and again 5:20 and again 5:30... I was waiting in the station for 6 hours.. If i have got the information early i could have saved my time.. This was very irritating and no one was there to help or in the help desk. This show that railway service has 0% customer service... I need a refund for the long waiting and for 0% customer service...   
 Hi, I was travelling in jaipur pune express (12940) on 15-aug-2017 with my wife from ramganjmandi to pune.My pnr number was [protected].My birth number was 25/26 in coach b-3 (3ac)I have been allotted a middle birth.in the middle birth there were 2 hooks which support the birth but in my case one hook was broken, i am attaching the images of the broken hook. I notified the problem to the coach attendant but he was rude to me, after that i told my problem to tte, after 2 hours of struggle around 12.00am midnight he allotted a seat to me in other coach (B1 - 52). First of all i had to leave my luggage and my wife in coach b-3 and had to travel alone.My wife was sleeping and around 2.00 am midnight coach attendant came with one home guard and he was trying to adjust that police guy on middle birth which was broken. My wife opposed to it but still he was forcing her to adjust that guy on middle birth. After so many arguments he went from there. But due to that incident my wife was not able to sleep whole night, she was scared too much due the behavior of the coach attendant. Even tte instructed him that birth should not be allotted to anyone.Coach attendant already knew that the seat hook was broken before but no one paid attention to that It was too much for me i have paid complete charge to railway but was not able to sleep for a minuet due to this incident. Why railway is too much careless about all these, fares are increasing like anything but the service is going down.I have wasted complete money for the ticket i could travel in general coach.I have seen one of the coach attendant was drinking whisky in the coach.You have to take legal action about that coach attendant.  — Thanks, ​​Kshitij [protected]

We have paid the money and still not able to sit inside coach and somehow managing in very difficult way whereas there was a girl with ticket of general and tt took her inside and gave her berth.. Is this is what supposed to happen with a passenger who paid the full money for third ac and on the other hand other girl with general ticket have been supposed to be provided the berth. Today i am disappointed a lot with my indian rialwyas.. Shame on you

Even berths will be dirty, damaged and full of dust especially side upper berth. Berths are filled with musiquotes even in running train. People are suffering alot with the mentioned. Please take immediate actions to correct this.

 Dear IR, I have noticed that after GST implementation, break journey and circular journey are discontinued. Neither government nor railway advertise this thing, why. It is stated that due to gst technical reason it is discontinued. I as a common man strongly condemn​ this move. How can raise this issue to prime minister. At least citizen has right to know what bad effect are of gst. Tks. Rajeev Singhvi

 Sir, I have booked a Railway Signalling item"NDT Fuse" from railway parcel booking office at Patna. The material has booked from Patna to Mathura Jn having RR No. [protected] on 16-Feb-17. The material is packed in 03 boxes at Patna office but at Mathura Jn I have received only 02 boxes of material. The parcel officer said that only 02 boxes has been unloaded at Mathura Jn and no further information of 01 box is available on website as well as at parcel office. I have tried to search at Mathura Jn but did not find the box. I have tried to file a complain on the number provided on Parcel India website but they have told me to put a complain in Mathura. I have further tried to complain at Mathura but they are telling to put a complain at Patna Parcel office. After so many effort I'm unable to locate the exact position of the material. For your information I'm attaching the RR copy along with the current status of material on website. So I request you to kindly look into this matter and do the needful so that the material can be retrieved.   
 I am working as a sub inspector of government railway police in telangana state ❨ mancherial, railway police station❩. I have registered a case against a person under section of ndps act and seized 4kgs of ganja on 2nd august 2017.in this act seizure panchanama should get conducted in presence of a gazetted officer. On that day local gazetted officers were not available at mancherial area. So i opted rly doctor of bellampally named m. Naveen. I have contacted him on phone, he accepted to do panchanama and advised me to send a requisition letter by hand. I have sent a letter by two constables on bike to bellampally which is about 22kms far. But he rejected the letter and used unusual language and replied that he is not willing to do panchanama and challenged me to take any kind of action which will fetch him nothing. I requested him for much time to be a part of controlling drug activities but he did not consider my words. With disappointment my constables returned to police station.Then i have sent a requisition letter to ramagundam rly doctor named deepa, but we faced the same problem. Both doctors didn't even touch my requisition letter, the whole day of my service on a case has been ruined where i have faced troublesome to answer my seniors. And these kind of irresponsive replies are repeatedly happening with the doctors.These doctors area comes under my rly police station jurisdiction that's why i opted them.Sir, we all are working together for our country, we have to bound to law. Without the support of other departments we can't prevent illegal drugs transportation.Sir, please take necessary action on the above two doctors who are not responsive towards govt. Duties.Thanking you.

Birth numbers 13 and 15 were vacant up to mirzapur or vindhyachal station and one family occupied the births at mirzapur or vindhyachal station. When i reached my destination rampur and unlocked my travel bag, i found a big cut inside my travel bag and found the sweet box which i had purchased from shaktinagar since i had gone to rampur fixing my daughter's marriage.

The theft has occurred between chopan and mirzapur and i suspect that the coach attendant may be involved in the incident.

 Early morning train from Una to New Delhi The Ticket counter told the people that we have no ticket the ticket will be available in the train...but no he lies a great lie once passengers are on board ...The Ticket check and what ever the man called how checks the ticked ask for the ticlet and passengers were like the counter did'nt give one but the Ticket checker said that you have to pay the fine and the fine of the seat for one person in Rs900 ..so indain railways are not that good even the platforms are like #### ...   
 Reference train no:16338, coach a1, travel date 10th august 17, We boarded the train on 10th august 17 from udupi and was horrified to find the condition of the toilets so dirty and imagine we had to travel in the train for the next 33 hrs unable to use the toilets and the fare which we had paid is 3030 per head totally 6060rs. Instead of travelling in such a pathetic condition we could alighted a flight and travelled comfortably. Swach abhyan everything seems to be only in paper and words but the condition of the railcoaches, bedrolls and the toilets are the worst unbeatable, please see to that the railways take up the matter seriously.   
 There are so many peoples in Ranthambore express 12465 traveling without ticket. No TT is coming no policeman is here. So much congestion is here. Reserved ticket persons have to fight for their seats from them. Please sought out this problem immediately. It's a very bad experience. Irctc have to look for this purpose. No room for legs. It's very very irritating to travel with Irctc like this. Nobody can go to washroom in this type of train. Very shameful for you

 Bpc stn (Sealdah div, er) refused to issue any return ticket on 11/8/17. The staff didn't show any reason and there was no notice issued by the station authority either. But other stations under this division are issuing return tickets. Return tickets are vital for many passengers to save time and last minute rush. Why we are not getting this facility? Does er not believe our time is valuable? Do we need to get in line every time for booking tickets? Kindly do the needful steps to solve the issue.

 In tapivan exp 17617 from mumbai to nashik the unreserved passengers in reserved compartments have increased to such a extend that at times the daily comutters don't get up easily if you show your reserved ticket. They ask to adjust in the small seat of three. The journey is so short that it's difficult to locate tc and resolve the issue. Stringent action by special squad and fine will improve the situation. Please do the needful so that a meaning is there for reservation or make the whole train general.

 There is not any toll free number to know the details of train and its timings... And also if we dail railway enquiry number 139 it charges 2 rupees per minute. Many of the middle class people cannot bare such amount of call rate. Even though the persons voice is not audible... Some of the railway applications like (Nets) shows wrong information. So, take action immediately.

For this casualness i have to waste 40minute in the station premesis.   
 Train number 12886 delayed regularly by 1-2 hrs specialty on saturday. I have tweeted several times to railway ministry but no action. My wife and son travels from chandrakona road to santragachi every saturday. She is a school teacher after doing her school after 1.30 hrs she came by bus and after that took my son and come to chandrakona railway station. She needs to wait at least 1 hrs most of saturday. Pathetic thing is no contact no in railway station so that she will ask first and then come to station the live railway running status is also not updated. What's happening to railway dept. Why no action has been taken to those careless people? Why railway minister is not replying my tweet? Why he is not taking action? Why this trail will be called as superfast? Why passengers like my wife and 8 years old has to suffer after full payment? We are really sorry for mr, prabhu. I saw you regularly inaugurated several thing and lot of tweets. For us its of no use instead your trains run on time. I know no answer and no action will be taken for this complain... Rip insian rail

Then using truecaller and facebook i got the name and photo of the person having my device. I rang him and he told he has got my mobile. On the next day morning i informed and submitted all the information i had to the grp kharagpur. How many days the police will take to catch the thief.

 Hi mumbai railway dept.On the above subject line for the railway complaint no. A/wr/bct/000250749. The given feedback is not satisfactory as the advance stage of pregnancy is already cover i. E. From 7th month to 9th month to allowed handicap coach.However, i wanted to suggest that, give permission to pregnant women can allow to travel from her initial stage i. E. From the 1st month to 9th month, because at the initial stage she need to take care. This is mainly i am talking about to western suburban railway line from virar to churchgate and vise versa. While traveling from virar to churchgate it is really impossible to get in ledies coach in between stations i. E. Naigaon, bhayender, mira road while pick hours.I wanted give my own experienced here.I am 3 months pregnant and while traveling from mira road to andheri, i could not able to get in in ledies coach, hence, i got in handicap coach dated 2 august 2017, there are more than 50% crowd are non handicap, i got in and the coach was had very rush, hence i got push by one man, so i told him "pls don't push as i am pregnant".In the same crowd on lady was there and she starting arguing with me, why are you come in this coach?, which month is going on? So i told her 3 month, now she started fighting stating with me. You people are not allow to travel while initial stage, govt can allow you only after 7th months, so i asked her why you are travelling from the coach as your are also not a handicap person, so she told me, "i am off duty otherwise i will let you know who i am and we people are allow to travel any of the coach".Now you tell me is this a really good behavior with pregnant woman and can't you people understand, how can she travel?This is very shameful.Pls do something indian railway for pregnant women.Jai hind

 The suburban train time tables for the chennai - chengalpattu route seems to have drawn up decades ago when there was not much outbound traffic beyond tambaram. Those were the days when the population in the suburbs commuted to the city for work or education. But with burgeoning it companies, industrial parks and engineering colleges in the city'outskirts, a large number of people travel from the city to the suburbs for work or education. But this huge and visible shift in travel patterns seems to have escaped the eyes and senses of the railway authorities in chennai. Most offices, banks, courts, colleges open around 9.30.-10 am. So the peak hours for travel would be between 8 am and 10 am. How does one justify a time table which offers one train from tambaram to cpt at 8.35 am and the next at 9.20 and a third at 9.51 am. The 9.20 train is a 8 coach memu and is invariably late. So it is always packed to the gills..Commuters from the city (Say nungambakkam or mambalam) including working women have to catch a train before 8.00 am if they have to reach work on time.in case they miss the one train even by a few seconds, they have no choice but to reach office or school only by 10.30 - 10.45. Will the railways please wake up and show some sympathy to hapless passengers? If they are unable to run additional trains within the city, they could atleast run shuttle services between tambaram and chengalpattu every 20 minutes between 8 and 10 am. This will greatly relieve passengers of stress and discomfort.For an immediate start, they could replace the antiquated memu with a regular 12 coach unit so that it can carry a few more passengers in relatively better comfort.One does pray this plea will be heard and something will be done about it. A thousand passengers will be grateful.Thank you.   
 I booked a ticket numbered 17274461 from mulund mumbai ticket counter by swiping my debit card. Supporting mr. Modi's cashless transaction. I have cancelled the ticket on 1/05/2017 since then i have not received my refund for the cancelled ticket.I have tried calling to customer executive and their i am hardly able to talk to anyone. They just pick the receiver and keep at one of the end. I just want to ask unless the government executive itself are not going to support mr prime minister's initiative how the hell we citizens will trust you. We are ready to help him but you people are just showing your way of working and what discourages us.And i know i wont get any response from you still i believe as a responsible citizen i need to do this at least.

 We were 3 ladies + 1yr baby girl, travelling to hosur though Yeshwanthapur-Hosur train on 3rd Aug'17 from Bangalore east around 7:06am to hosur, once we reached hosur, since it was our new route, one of our relative had come to pick us up, but he forgot to take platform ticket. The Railway employee stopped at us and asked for it, once he knew that the person did not have platform ticket, started to show all his men power.. Giving us 3 options1) combine the penalty with other lady who passed on platform instead of road and make as a single complaint2) since we questioned him, for us separate complaint with 270/-3) come to Bangalore police station, and go to court and pay 1000/-After creating a big screen show with us, he took 300/- and gave us slip for 279. Just for 30/- he had to misbehave like this is very shame...Don't know how to communicate with women's, he wants to show that he is a men, doing duty and accepting bribery in a very prestige's way.People like this spoil the respect that is given to railways..behavior   
 Date of the incident:- 22 jul 17.Client number:- [protected], [protected]Description of the incident:- on 22 jul 17, train no.- 22405 (Bpg anvt garib rath) reached patna jn around 3 hour late. My wife (Mrs. Anushka) (Pnr no - [protected]) along with my 4 1/2 year old son had to board on the train at patna jn for anand vihar terminal. She had to board in coach no. G5. She was waiting for the train at platform no. 4 as per the led display, showing the arrangement of the coaches in the train. When the train arrived, the arrangement of coaches was not as per the display. It lead to stampede, there were many passengers to board on. All passengers were running around on the platform to get their berth in respective coach. And the same was for my wife and my kid. She has to rush 5-6 coaches back along with luggage and kid. An irresponsible action by a few particular gov servants of railway created a very untoward situation.in that incident, my wife became too panic and my son sustained a minor injury. She spent a upset night throughout her journey.In this regard, i register a complaint by sms at mob no. [protected] on 22 jul 17 at 2351 hrs. The reference id is[protected]. But as a reply, it was suggested that the complaint does not pertain to south central railway, directing me to send the same to mob no. [protected]. On 23 jul 17 at 0920 hrs, i re-registered the complaint to mobile no. [protected]. And again at the same no. On 24 jul 17 at 1239 hrs. A positive response from indian railways is still awaited. I am sending the snapshot of the messages as proof. Here, i like to ask a question to so called our incredible indian railways. Is it the step to make our nation a superpower. We are always looking for new technologies. What is it's use, even we are not able to properly use the available resources/ technologies. Come on...Desirable resolution:- i want the person responsible for this to be early named out and must be punished. Let me know about the person and the punishment granted. I want redressal of my grievances with a compensation for mental harassment of my wife & my kid.

 Please note that i was scheduled to travel with pnr 650 4195750. The ticket was wait listed and i continuously checked for the status since 6:00 p. M. Onwards and finally got the status ~8:20 p. M. Only. Since the ticket was in wl and travel for 2 days, i decided to cancel the ticket. Now, prs counter was already closed by then hence, approached current counter at manduadih station. They suggested that this can only be done at the originating station i. E. Mughalsarai and it takes ~2-2.5 hours of travel from varanasi.As per the information online, http://erail.in/Rail/RailwayRefundCharges.aspx, i approached the counter and they informed that it is not accepting. This was at 8:36 a. M.How can a passenger with this approach cancel the ticket for trains in the night (Between 8:00 p. M. To 8:00 a. M.) especially for the originating stations such as mughalsarai which serves mainly passengers from varanasi.Please help with my cancellation and refund of money.

 Dear sir, This is to bring your kind attention on a kind service provided by railway department. Discipline meaning can not be better learn by anyone other than railway department.I am not surprised, if all of the railway's department's staff would be in the discipline as the train is. By seeing what is written, you would not believe, you presume everything is ok, my staff is of not military disciplined but it is discipline. Then can i ask a question, if your staff is following duties on time, how come train is suffering from the hindrance of getting delay for 12 hours. Would you believe this staff being in discipline.Nobody is cared in this country, unless they face the problem, i would request you to wait on a platform for 12 + hours to board a train, and do let us know how does it feel. But please do the travelling as a common men, where you are given limited food so that you can eat after boarding the train. You got to wait in the waiting room where you got to keep an eye on your cellphone battery and so to your luggage. How would you feel if you are being tortured by railway department like that. I have my mother and father waiting on platform for more than 12 hours, i would not wish if anyone's father have to wait for that long time to board a train, we are in 2017. This brilliant service has to be applauded, my father and mother waiting on gorakhpur station to come to delhi, as the train timing was 7:00 am hence they came on the station at last night to board the train on time. That has also stretched it to above 12 hours. It is well now 20 hours. If you are a human being reading this, you should feel what they are going thorough. My dad got an opportunity to serve railways in his young time. I am glad he is not part of this failure department, for which people run with money in the bag to get a job in railways. Wonderful service, wonderful art by railway.Think before going to office starting your work, how many people daily suffer by your disciplined staff. I see officials roaming from here to there, that may be a part of their job, but roaming at the right place is what they all are missing, i am disappointed if suresh prabhu sir would not have been one of them. Else this would not have been a situation.I am extremely sorry to be very uneducated writing stupidity, but this stupidity is real, as this is happening with my parents.Thank you, Awesome work railway department, You deserve 8th pay commission as a part of incentive for the brilliantly serving, so called new india (2017) by my idol modi jee.   
 Dear sir, My sister (R. Ragini) is traveling with rac ticket in coach s4 berth no. 71 from bdcr (Bhadrachalam road) to sc (Secunderabad) in train no 17025 vide ticket pnr no: [protected] on 31-july-2017. As it is a night journey and my sister is traveling alone and she requested to ttc in beginning of the journey that if any seat get vacant during the journey than please inform her. He told her that all the coaches having rac, so, you will get the berth according to your number. But ttc allotted seat to someone, who was having wait listed ticket booked after me and he given seat to unreserved passengers also. My relatives and friends traveling in the same train had got berths, even their wailting list number is more than my sister ticket. As per ticket number she should get berth first. When she questioned ttc about this he not responded well. So, i requested you to please penalized the ttc for his unhuman behavior. I am ready to come as many times you will. Call me regarding this case. If in future you want to pay some compensation than please deduct that amount from his salary not from government department because government given him the best pay structure to him.Thanking youR.

 I came to bangalore majestic railway station to drop my mother as she was travelling alone.Me and my dad hadn't taken the platform ticket which is wrong i agree.While coming out we were asked about the platform ticket which we didn't have and he said we have to pay fine which we readily agreed.On asking how much he said it is 310 per person which i refused to believe and he started talking brashly and shouting.Others who passed by weren't asked. We got a receipt of excess fare and not the fine receipt.

 I have often faced misbehaviour of people of kisan union in nauchandi express train (Saharanpur to allahabad). Today (30.07.2017), i am travelling in the above said train to visit lucknow and unfortunately kisan union people in a large number travelling in the same train. They have acquired whole train, even the reserved coaches including ac coaches, female compartments. They are not afraid of police or anything. They are sitting on other people's seats, even on the seats of ladies, misbehaving with everybody, abusing everybody. All of them are without tickets. Women who are travelling alone like me, are feeling unsafe as they are teasing them, raising up their curtains. I, a common indian girl, a government employee, a taxpayer earnestly request you higher authorities to ensure safety and security of common people from such anti social elements, hooliganism. This type of journey sometimes ends up in to the worst nightmare of some people specially girls. Please do something urgently.   
 Train no. 11010 / sinhagad express.This train pune to mumbai cst, halts at thane station, but this fact has not been incorporated in railway booking computer, hence all passangers have to purchase dadar ticket if they have to go to thane.Hence i request please make necessary changes in the computer program software.Thanking you in advance.

 At nasik road station, the contractor is charging excess parking fees. He had deployed goons and thugs who doesnt have uniform or proper id cards for the same. Parking fees prescribed by railways is depicted. However they are charging excessive fees. For 1 hour railways had prescribed fees of rs.5 for a motor bike. However theese goons are demanding rs 10 or even rs 20 for the same. While questioned they charged against me. A rpf officer was witness for the same. They have even not printed rs 5 as parking charges for one hour, even the board depicting the parking fees by railways recommend only rs 5. Still they asked me to pay rs. 20 which i have paid. They were not ready to give receipt also. Hence my humble request is to you is look in to the matter an do the needful.   
 We went bokaro steel city railway staion on[protected] at around 7:55 pm and we were forcefully charged rs 15/- despite we were on exit point of the parking premises after dropping our relative within 2 minutes.Parking personnel have earlier told us that if u pick or drop someone and checkout the parking within 5 minutes after parking then you will not have to pay. However they charged us forcefully and misbehaved and humilliated us. They told us do whatever u can do but we will take money like this only.We even requested them that please see the cctv footage and show us if the duration of entry and exit will be more than 5 days than we will give you rs1000/-.They told us screen is not working and you have to give the charges anyway.They were 5 person and they humilliated us and forced us to pay the charges which was actually not to be charged.This kind of activities should be stopped by taking harsh action on them then only we can expect our beloved nation to get on the top of the world.Corruption and wrong doings of people should be taken seriously and strict action should be taken at every level be it at lower level or higher.Its not the matter of rs 15/- but its the matter of type of people and style of serving at public places... And their tone and behaviour reflected like no one will ever take any action on them ever.Please take action on those people and intimate us.. PleaseNot for the sake of our satisfacton but for our better nation.Abhishek rajDeputy managerSbiMob no -[protected]

 Dear sir/ mam,  As i had travelled from pune to varanasi on 27/7/17, in 11037 pune - gkp exp. My seat was in s11. First of all the coach doesnt have the charging points, the food quality is worst, and the most important thing is no security available in the train. The less security the more hawkers and peddlers and beggers has came in the train. This had my first worst experience in the journey from this train. Kindly take some action.

 I have traveled in 18474 jodhpur puri express twice and i have never seen such a dirty, filthy train ever. Lots of rats are there in that train and the toilets are never cleaned. When i asked the cleaners about the rats they said that they can't find them. Are u serious... It is your duty to clean the coaches and you are saying that you can't find them. I request the railway ministry to please look after this matter as passengers are not at all comfortable to travel on that train.   
 In sealdah-dankuni section, frequency of local trains is very less during office time in the morning & evening. The trains are running late. Very rush, the situation is very critical, horrible. Space in waiting room in bally halt station is very inadequate. Many passengers use this section. Many local trains in howrah-barddhaman main line are not having stop in bally station. Eastern rail section should look into it.

 Dear sir/madam, It is very serious matter to serve bed quality of food in rajdhani train for passenger which infected our health. My son voted after having meal of train served by railways in side rajdhani and rest of member complaint loose motion.in fact, this must be consider attempt of murder by serving non hygiene meal to the passenger.We were returning from jammu to delhi on 25th jun 2017 by rajdhani. We requested for doctor to ticket officer to assist us. He told us there is no doctor in the rajdhani train. This is how indian railways prove himself irresponsible for the people health.This is very embarrassing situation for us to face this disaster travelling due to irresponsibility of indian railways. We paid very good amount to travel in the rajdhany train. But serve level in the train is very bed.Railways must pay penalty to passenger who suffer with bed quality food.Thanks to look into the matter and come out with proper answer as this type of news heard from railways very frequent. Indian railways isno more trust transportation partner of the indian people.

 I have lodged railway theft complaint on march 21 2017 from yeswantpur to secunderabad train no. 12736 garibrath theft of rupees three lakhs.

 I was a passenger traveled by train no.16382 pnr no. [protected] doj 22.07.17. Via trvl to cstm.. Having seat no 49 coach s1. Noticed that lot of passengers from station tiruper to wadi entered in to our reserved compartment and was very inconvenient to us. Since they were supposed to travel in general compartment and no checking whether genuine tickets were used can railways do proper action accordingly.   
 Train running time status scheduled arrival time vs actual arrival times, are not updated with the actual arrival time. For example, today train 12672 (Train started at source on 26th july 2017) actually reached mas station at 6:17 am as it was running late by 1 hour 12 minutes. But when they updated the systems with back dated time and updated the actual arrival time as 5:26 am, just late by 21 minutes. This clearly shows how they were manipulating the data and showing incorrect status updates to their higher management and passengers.

 We travelled from tirunelveli to mumbai on 23rd july 2017. We had booked caoch in 3rd ac, b1 seat 9 and 10. The coach was third class and horrible. It did not feel like an ac coach.

Please dont waste our hard earned money this way.

 Sir, With due respect in vide of your reply letter the reason or the inconvenience you said was unsatisfactory. As you said in your letter without following display board, i must have halo an enquiry at enquiry office, so let me tell you the real incident i reached station quite corky before the schedule departure of train and had visit to enquiry office for asking about train details, the personnel at enquiry office or counter said train is 5 minutes late regarding platform no he said you must follow display board. As you said in your letter. I did not reached station in time and did not enquired at enquiry office, for your information you must have an eye to “ cctv” footage on that particular day “16/05/2017 whether i reached station in time or not or not enquired at enquiry office; i am sending my photo along with this letter, with “cctv “ footage you can have your answer Another important thing kharagpur railway station is not a small station, it is a biggest junction among all indian railway stations; so it is quite difficult to board the correct train at correct time without announcement or with the help of display board, not only biggest station but also arrangement of platforms like 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 in a different odd and haphazard manner. Let me have an eye to small story you might have watched m. S dhoni biopic movie “m. S dhoni, the untold story “, if you not you must watch it because in that movie the t. T. E m. S dhoni could not attend train in correct time and the railway personnel or heaol of t. T. E it self said in that movie “ the arrangement of platform in kharagpur ne m. S dhoni ka examleli” so if a t. T. E cannot attend a train in correct time how can a common man can. Now coming to your announcement many trains come by and go, i mishit have not put a good ear to announcement because of your railway personnel said to follow display board, and you said due to technical problem the train was not being displayed in display board, the technical problem was yours not mine why should i suffer due to your departmental problem. Let me say one thing, when a common man does not teaches a proper. Ticket does not your departmental person imposes fine or chillan, does he forgives any person without taking fine or chillan not at ll. He / she takes proper fare and proper fine. Like this we the common man had problem your department does not forgive us, like that when your department has problem why should i forgive you. It is simple “tit for tat” your department must also bear the tine and charges as your department takes fine and charges both. Due to your departmental problem i could not reach c. M. Chospital vellore in time to cure my ailing mother, so i visited different hospital.in west bengal which expensed me heavy more than 1 laks 1nrand the result was quite unsatisfactory. I am a common man and poor farmer, it is quite difficult to arrange money and expense it, and all went is vain. So as railway department takes fine due to mistake if common man, the railway department must also pay the similar fine and expenses because of their fault or technical problem. Therefore i hope that you must take this matter seriously and solve the required problem within a stipulated time. I am waiting for your grateful reply.Pnr no-[protected]Train no-2287Consumer complain id-352535  Thanking youYour’s faithfully  Dilip karan Mob - [protected] Email-amlan. Shanku@gmail.com

 I have booked 2 tickets on 16.07.2017 and the pnr numbers are [protected], [protected]. Both are confirmed tickets and i'm not able to travel in the trains. The reason is sms for the booking didn't reach me. Usually i would login in our site and confirm the seat numbers. So i didn't care about the sms. But this time on 23.07.2017, from evening 6.30 they have taken the site for maintanence activity and they restored next day morning only. On 23.07.2017, i went to the station and enquired about my tickets in the enquiry section. They told me there is no name in the list. So i do not have any clue about my tickets. So i'm not able to travel in the said two tickets. Now if i cancel the tickets, i will not get any refund. So kindly refund my amount since there is no fault in my side.

But i shocked they did nothing about them. Even counter staff also.   
 Train no 56903 arrive time at 5:10 am but the ticket issued at 5:07 am very late. I was first to take ticket so i got luckily train delayed about 20 mins so all consumers got ticket. If train arrived at 5:10 am means consumers would not get ticket this is the worst service provided... Actually the ticket counter employee had slept upto 5 clock am no one had complained...

The complainant having some grievances regarding e-ticket, registered a complaint against irctc at www.consumercomplaints.in provided with personal mobile no.

 Dear sir, i am a resident of bangalore and visit our home town at kottayam, kerala once in 2 or 3 years. Usually we travel by bangalore exp (Train no. 16525). Sir, it is a usual practice of the public to get into the reserved compartments and occupy the seats that we would have booked 4 months back and they do not even move on our repeated requests. Last time i was travelling with my family and my aged parents and we had to stand for several hours till the passengers who had occupied our seats got off the train by around 7 p. M. We do even find a tt to help us. Request you to kindly look into the matter as it has become a tension for us passengers to book a ticket in this train fearing we are not going to get our seats that we had reserved.

 Dear all (Responsible railway authorities) this is for the information train no. 19578 jamnagar - tirunelveli express. My pnr no. [protected] date of my journey[protected], scheduled departure from madgoan, 23:58. This has really hurt with the facility provided by central government to general public. Before i get to your notice the sate and central ministers have governent vehicles, flight travel who do not care for general public.The situation which i faced is really worst in my life. I had a meeting for which i had booked ticket thinking that i will reach at the prescribed time. But for my fate the train was delayed for 3 hours the train was suppose to reach at 6:20am. But reached at 10:15am the reason behind it is crossing. If crossing means it doesnt mean moving from one side. I would like to inform that our train halted but 4 trains was given the green signal. For name sake it is "express train". The train should be renamed to cycle train. Drivers are illegible and careless with their behaviour. The only solution is make railway privatization only then will have clean and best timely, prompt service. The nda government fails to handle the railway department is the conclusion i can give.Mr. Suresh prabhu - take some action only then i can call you railway minister.   
 My brother and me boarded the train tata kcg exp, train no 07439, on 18-07-17. This was expected to take us till kacheguda railway station at about 5 in the morning on 20-07-17. The train was already late for about 3 hours and we were still on the station named malkajgiri. After waiting for another about one and half hour they announced in telgu that the train cannot go further and the passengers will have to take bus to kacheguda station. Since we didn't understand telgu one of our co-passenger translated to us in hindi. I was literally disappointed by this as we had heavy luggage and we were new to this place. So we had no option but to take either bus or a taxi to my destination. Since we were new to this place we decided to go for uber.in-spite of opting for uberpool i had to pay around 200 rs.

After showing this he take me to the station room and said u will have to pay the penalty. When i asked that person that i am having a pass why i should pay the extra amount. He started assaulting me by saying that if i dun pay the amount he will take me to the court directly. His fellow people was also encouraging him. He misbehaved a lot and also bringing a policeman in the picture to showcase his words.Money is not a major part in this but the way he took the advantage of his position was wrong.After asking his name he told me that his name is vivek kumar singh and headquater was in grant road and he was serving a bandra terminal.

 Chief Reservation Supervisor (Officer) of Reservation Centre, Jabalpur Junction (WCR) has refused me to issue tickets in student concession quota because of overwriting in my concession form because in the column of age our college's clerk had written our sex then he tried to correct it in his overwriting. I had told to Chief Reservation Supervisor to resolve the problem by verifying our age but he had said a clear cut no to me.   
 Dear sir..This is with regards to two wheeler parking at sanathnagar railways station in hyderabad. Usually at other stations we will have 12 hours and 24 hours parking facility so that the more time we park we will charge lesser amount. But in sanathnagar station they are charging rs10 for 3 hour's. It will be a additional burden for the travellers who are frequently traveller. So my request is to implement 24hrs basis for the convenience of travellers. Thank you.   
 There is only one platform in khurdpur railway station, jalandhar, punjab. Opposite side only railway track is there. No platform is available.

Therefore i am requesting to concerned authority to please at list mail train must halt platform n.1

 I was travelling in s1 boogie, seat number 21. It was raining heavily and to my surprise, the boogie had water leaking through the top. While boarding train, i realized it was an old boogie with torn seats and no charging point attached to seat. This was not much of an issue but when i was in my seat sleeping, the water droplets fell on me, i got drenched and my phone got damaged, who's gonna bear the losses? Do i book a railway ticket to get drenched like this? If this is such an old boogie, why not replace it? Isnt there any checking performed before attaching a boogie?

Already a written complaint was submitted. But no action.

 Sir, We were travelling from puri to agra in train utkal express and train no 18477. My pnr no 630-3799665 in that train. I have my child girl of 5yrs of age. Already four tte checked our tickets and he said ok. When we were reached our destination station then a tte came who is seated from jhasi... He stopped us and said that there will be charged a ticket for my child. Noone asked for the ticket before that. Even after that we were ready to give the half ticket but he refused and asked for penalty because we were not ready to pay 200 rs. Without any reason which asked to pay to tte. When we asked for the reason for that 200 rs then he used abusive words towards us and said "tumhari family sath nhi hoti to batata tumhe or ye charge dena pdega tumhe". When i again started the argument then he charged extra fare for my child. My coach no is s11 and seat no rac55, rac55 and rac63. After that argument someone told me that "aesi complaint uske against pehele bhi 2-3 jano ne ki thi or use bahut sunaya bhi tha railway department ne" When i reached and take my luggage out, i directly went to the office of railways, there is someone at designated officer who told me to file thee complaint against him and the action will be taken properly. It is my request that if i am wrong then all ttes who came before he came then they all are also wrong. Or ye possible ho nahi sakta ki sab ek sath galat ho ek hi baat ke liye. So please take necessary actions.

 Horrible experience!!Sir, today i went to escort my old parents travelling by janshatabdi train leaving at 6:10 am. There was no platform information in tv display or audio at 6:00 am. When inquired at the counter they said it will be announced later. We waited finally the train arrival information came along with platform information. We were shocked because it was 4 minutes left and my old parents cannot run up the stairs and reach other platform. We had no time to check any other transport options. With great difficulty when reached the platform. The train was just arriving.in hurry we checked the display for coach position. The display information was not available. We had to ask co-passengers to find the d3 position. Somebody told it is far on front side. I had to literally lift my father and run to the d3 coach and put them in train. We had almost missed the train. I really do not believe it is one of the metro city station. And the situation is shameful. I checked the with other passengers and got to know that it is usual there.

 We have tried to send one consignment of mattress through railway from kanpur to hyderabad. Staff reached kanpur station (Govindpuri) with consignment. Staff there informed us to contact one mediator (Jagdish bajpai) there. He told us it will take approx 13500/- to book consignment. We handedover consignment and money to him. After 10-15 minutes he came with buily of 19000 something and asking for 7000/- in addtion which he said is for booking clerk. We informed him that this is very costly and we dont want to send the consignment. He said you have to pay 5000 for penalty for canceling consignment and also he refused to give us any receipt. Booking clerk told us no receipt will be issued and if you want go to allahabad.

 This train is the only train to reach at kancheepuram before 10 am. It reaches daily late for which daily official commuters suffering late. The signal management at chengalpattu, palur, walajabad railway stations are very poor. The railway authorities are requested to look into the matter and ensure that this train reaches at kancheepuram in scheduled time.   
 Why this complaint cell is opened. Answer is to save railway. Because this cell is not going to help anyone. Railway is like "ulta chor kotwal ko dante". Why because i cancelled my ticket vide tdr 047233 from narnaul (Nnl). Booking clerk advised me to keep tdr copy for future reference. I did so. But i did not get my refund. I did online complaint twice. Lastly railway did not refunded my money saying that i did not deposited my tdr copy at concrned office. Now find out who is suppose to tell me that tdr copy will be deposited and where will be deposited. I have spent a lot of money in last one year to get my refund. Who will tell me that railway raised two copy of tdr. What is meant of keeping one copy with railway. Why railway took my account number. Railway clerk says keep tdr copy for refund and now refund department telling refusing to refund. Is it not a dadagiri. Wah meri railway "chit bhi teri aur pay bhi teri"   
 I booked ticket in train no.12423 through irctc dated 1st sept, 2017 (Pnr. [protected]). I also booked return ticket on train no. 12424, dated 2nd sept, 2017 ([protected]). The train 12423 was cancelled by railways due to flood situation in bihar, and full refund was provided for this ticket. However, the train 12424 was not cancelled by railways. As i could not perform my travel on 1st sept, i was forced to cancel the return ticket manually for which irctc charged 25% charge. Please note that the return ticket cancellation was not my wilful cancellation. It was the railways problem of cancelling the onward train for which i had to cancel the return ticket manually. So, cancellation charge should not have been taken from me for this ticket too.So, i request you hereby for the needful to refund me the cancellation charge of ticket no. [protected] (Train no. 12424, dated 2nd sept). Else, give me the justification for which i do not deserve it. Please tell me whether i cancelled the return ticket for my mistake/wish/convenience or i cancelled the ticket due to railways related action.Regards, Bikash   
 This is related to train no 74033 (Delhi sarai rohilla to farukhnagar) dmu passenger running between delhi sarai rohilla and farukhnagar and this train has not run in its scheduled time in any single day. The distance between both the stations is only 48 kms and travel time is 1hr 35 minutes but the train departs around 50 minutes late every day from delhi sarai rohilla which is its originating station and accumulates late on the way too. Particularly working ladies and man's face trouble as it is uncertain when it will reach the destination. I am astonished when indian railway knows that the train cannot run in time why they print time table. It is better to discontinue the train between delhi sarai rohilla and farukh nagar as in this section no train runs in time even originating train from delhi sarai rohilla a starts 40-50 minutes and odd late and that too every day. Will the railway ministry will look into the matter and take steps to check the loss of hundreds of man hours, loss of students and employees using this train?

 Sir,  I'm kalyan bid from kankinara. Last sunday i was go to bishnupriya halt that is near about nabadwip. And monday i was back from there through this station. When i go to the ticket counter for ticket, in that case i have no cash, only coins are available in my pocket. But the person who was sited on the ticket counter, he directly refused to take coins of rs.2. I was helpless in that time, because my daughter was with me she is too tiny. After some time i was beg from this guy that "please give me the ticket by coins". But the ticket seller was beahaved as an businessman. After that i was violently speak him up. But nothing worked. The time was near 7.30 p. M approx. Kankinara is too far from bishnupriya. So, at the last time i picked up the train without ticket with my tiny daughter. And i was so harrased by this immature works of a govt. Employee. And i really think to punnished all of those person who just take there job as an own business. Sir, i really don't know what should i do. But as an indian i want the justice.My ph no: [protected]/[protected]Mail i'd: tanmoyviper@gmail.com   
 I want to lodge a complaint regarding the railway. Let me start with the incident that happened because of the glitch from the railway portal endI booked ticket for bolpur s niketan station for 3 candidates in train (15659) (Kanchanjunga exp) from sealdah station for 31st-aug-2017. I came to know that from the enquiry cell that the train will not be available but still we are getting options to book tickets and moreover we are able to book tickets. And after knowing the incident when we are cancelling the ticket, howcome money is deducted when there is a glitch from portal's end. If the train doesn't have problem with their availability status, then when we are cancelling tickets the whole amount should be refunded. I guess the railway portal should be aware of that. I was refunded with 40 rupees when i cancelled it on 24th and again had to book another ticket for 31st again as i had a university work to do. I need my whole money refunded as it was a problem from the portals end. Please don't misutilise people's money like this. This is the request to the railway board to understand the financial status of all the person and donot take money in this unethical manner.Ps-i want my whole money to be refunded as no information was updated in the portal, instead there was ticket availability status and we could book the ticket. I believe action will be taken against this and improvement should also be done in the portal and i hope this portal is there to help people rather than muting the mouths or just for a showoff that you have a complaint portal

 Sir, My name is vinu prasad. Because of some personal reasons i have visited mumbai for 10 days and on 29th of august i have booked a sleeper ticket from ltt - kcvl train no -22113 for the same day travel with premium tatkal fare - rs:1405 through irctc app and once i reached the station i able to know that the flood in mumbai stopped the movement of all trains. So i waited almost 16 hours and then i cancelled the ticket because the station people not given any proper information as the train will start or not. Then i log in to irctc website and cancelled the ticket and filed the tdr. Then i have booked a fresh ticket for ltt-tvc through current reservation. The other passengers who are booked the ticket from the counter all got the full refund for the same ltt - kcvl train. But my case was different as i booked through the irctc website. So i just follow the procedure and waited for the update from the railway regarding the refund for the ticket. On 5th september i received a mail from irctc showing that i am not eligible for the refund of the ticket. Could you please tell me why it happened as if a counter ticket person is getting full refund of the fare and i booked through the irctc website and i am getting zero refund. Please explain if you can???!!! As paid the dynamic fare of rs 1405 instead of rs 650 for a sleeper ticket. I was waited on the railway station for nearly 20 hours without food and drink and even not have place to sit or sleep as it was so over crowded.My permanent address as followsVinu prasad, tc-72/2308 (1), panickers house, ponnara nagar, muttathara, vallakkadavu po trivandrum -695008.

 Today i booked two tickets to and from from vadodara to bharuch. My journey hour is only 60 min but train late for 40 to 45 min. I can travel by my car also but when we see if two person travel then it is not good to travel from car. To save environment i used public transport and what i got from indian railways waiting on platform. No sitting arrangements, not a single fan on platform. I am with my 4 year old son. I want to show him that train is also good for travel. But i could not. Now he never want to travel by train. You can understand my feelings. Shameful to indian railways.RegardsAmit patelPnr no. 836 321 6227

 Hi, I am here to complain regarding the dynamic fare pricing that was introduced in rajdhani trains. I am a regular traveler in nzm-bangalore rajdhani trains and i have been noticing the fare pricing of the rajdhani train (Train no. 22692). I was trying to book tickets from bhopal to bangalore on train no. 22692. The total fare from bhopal to bangalore was shown as rs. 3175 which included a dynamic fare of rs. 725. The base fare is rs. 1811 which means it is 40% on the base fare. However, the fare from nzm (The source station) to bangalore on the same train 22692 on the same date (1st december 2017) is rs. 2965 which is lower than the fare from bhopal to bangalore. There were more than 300 births available from nzm to bangalore whereas the booking position from bhopal to bangalore was wl2.I understand that the trains have certain number of birth quota from every station with highest quota from the source station. The number of birth quota from bhopal to bangalore is far less than from nzm to bangalore. For e. G. I see that there are only 8 births in the reservation quota from bhopal to bangalore as compared to 311 birth quota from delhi to bangalore for train no. 22692.Due to this, as soon as even 5 births are booked from bhopal, the dynamic fare system kicks in which is added to the base fare. This results in the tickets from bhopal to bangalore more than the fare from delhi to bangalore on the same train at the same time. This is not fare pricing policy and is some form of cheating from railways. I have seen that more than 100 seats from delhi to bangalore remain available many time till the last date of travel whereas the railways is charging excess fare from stations like bhopal and nagpur on the same train at that time. Given this fare pricing system, it is cheaper to book the ticket from delho to bangalore and then change the boarding station to nagpur as compared to booking the ticket directly from nagpur to bangalore in rajdhani trains. This type of dynamic fare system should be relooked at by railways and corrected so that the passengers are not forced to pay more using this pricing strategy.Himanshu agrawal[protected]   
 Owing to private compulsions i cancelled my railway tickets (Pnr 840-8860845) for journey from cstm to howrah, purported to be undertaken on 16.02.17 in proper manner in the office of the acm, ser under chief commercial manager (Refund), ser, kolkata-700001 on 13.01.17 and duly applied for refund of fare in prescribed format on 16.01.17. It needs mention that though i had bought my reservation ticket (Confirmed) bearing no. 06376982 from city booing centre at cornwallis street, kolkata-700004, refund against cancellation was not allowed from the city booking centre ss per extant order. It is unfortunate and pitiable that even after lapse of seven long months, the refund office of the c. C. M, ser has not cared to refund me the admissible fare against cancelled ticket. Time and again i have personally visited the office-in question, called on the dcm (Refund), but to no avail. I mailed to c. C. M, ser and the honourable minister but i i have received no communication from the office in this regard. I am a senior citizen living on my meagre pension. Rs. 5430.00 as is reportedly payable to me is not a small amount to me. I fail to see how can the authorities be so callous, insensitive and indifferent to public grievance. Hope some positive response.
