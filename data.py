lt=["Indian Railways — train running very late - It was 22nd of March 2018 I have started my journey from Anand Vihar to KATIHAR by the so called AC super fast special train Arunachal express 02412. Me really very disappointed to see that the situation of Indian railways is getting worse and worse day by day despite change of government. I am writing this complain but not sure whether this would reach to the correct officials or concerned departments. And if it reaches to the concerned department by chance then also any corrective measures would be taken or not. Why always we the people suffer and not the so called ministers and govt. Officers?Our train could not reach the first stoppage, Kanpur in 9 hrs can anyone imagine. Would railways take the responsibility and compenstate all those who are in loss due to the delayed train. Shame on Indian railways and all those who do fake promises","Indian Railways — failed air conditioning in rajdhani first class-As writing this message, 22nd March 2018, time 1030hrs I am on board Train no. 22824 Coach H1, C cabin vide PNR No. [protected], have been repeatedly asking attendant to fix the A/c as it's too warm / hot.

lt.append("Indian Railways — partial receipt of booked packages and fear of lost packages - Sir,  We would like to bring to your notice our plight at nizamuddin parcel office, apathy of the staff, consequent callousness and hardship caused to us. We have booked two packages [prr no: [protected] and [protected]], each containing 8 items from visakhapatnam to nizamuddin on 2/3/2018. These packages contained wooden cot parts for furniture. Messages were sent after booking of these packages. However, later no communication was made to us regarding loading or unloading of these packages. Anxious to know the status, we reached the parcel office on 7th march 2018 at 11:00 am to enquire. Then the drama unfolded, we were made to run a marathon from one platform to another and godown and so on. Nearly after 3 hours, some items (7 out of 16 pieces from 2 packages) were found. With respect to the remaining, we were told to contact visakhapatnam parcel office where the booking was done. We could not do that immediately. We sought a remedy to our travails from the unrelenting staff [sh s. D. Meena/cpsr, sh ganga ram/ delivery clerk and 6th no. Platform parcel clerk] who were merciless.  Out of despair we approached the station director who directed sh. Sd meena, cpsr to release the received items (7 in no.) after duly filling in the unloading status in computer. The same was done after further 2:30hrs delay lasting till evening (5:30 or 5:45 pm). We also complained about the attitude of the delivery clerk (Sh. Ganga ram) to the cpsr in writing to let him know of our hardship. Notwithstanding these events, our packages haven’t been completely delivered yet. Therefore, we would request you let us know the shipping status of the remaining 9 items and also direct concerned staff to trace those packages and deliver to us. Thanking you")

The railways, should stop providing water bottles to passengers and encourage the passengers to bring their own water bottles.
